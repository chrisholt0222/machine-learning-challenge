# Machine Learning - Exoplanet Exploration

![exoplanets.jpg](Images/exoplanets.jpg)

## Background

Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system. The project goal is to develop machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset.

The field [koi_disposition] 
 "CONFIRMED": objects confirmed to be exoplanets.
 "CANDIDATE": have not yet been formally classified
"FALSE POSITIVE" objects determined not to be exoplanets.
Hence, drop "CANDIDATE" rows for training models


### Preprocess the Data

* Preprocess the dataset prior to fitting the model.
* Perform feature selection and remove unnecessary features.
* Use `MinMaxScaler` to scale the numerical data.
* Separate the data into training and testing data.

### Tune Model Parameters

* Use `GridSearch` to tune model parameters.
* Tune and compare at least two different classifiers.

### Reporting

* Create a README that reports a comparison of each model's performance as well as a summary about your findings and any assumptions you can make based on your model (is your model good enough to predict new exoplanets? Why or why not? What would make your model be better at predicting new exoplanets?)
